  Agent Files:

  1. ReAct Agent:
  /Users/davidkypuros/Documents/GitHub_Local/mithun/agent/react_agent.py
    - Full ReAct implementation with Mistral API integration
    - Tools: AddTodoTool, DeleteTodoTool, ListTodosTool
    - Thought → Action → Observation loop

  Updated Files:

  2. Flask API: /Users/davidkypuros/Documents/GitHub_Local/mithun/app/app.py
    - Added /agent/execute endpoint to run ReAct agent
    - Integrated with agent module
  3. Frontend UI: /Users/davidkypuros/Documents/GitHub_Local/mithun/index.html
    - Updated to use agents for add/delete operations
    - Shows full agent reasoning process in activity log
    - Color-coded steps: thoughts (gray), actions (blue), observations (cyan),
  answers (green)

  How it works:

  - When you add/delete a todo, it goes through the ReAct agent
  - Agent thinks about the task, decides on action, executes it
  - All steps are logged in the right panel with emojis and colors
  - Uses Mistral API from .env file for LLM reasoning (falls back to rules if API
  unavailable)

  The app is now using intelligent agents to manage todos with visible reasoning
  steps!
